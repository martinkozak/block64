block64
=======

**Block64** is a replacement for original [crypto64][3] gem. It can encrypt
and decrypt arbitrary length strings by [RSA][4] public/private key. It's
fixed for *use with latest Ruby* and *much faster* than original.

### Usage

API is trivial and usage is simple:
    
    require "block64"
    
    key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA::new(<pem-encoded-key>)
    encoded = key.encode64(<some-very-long-message>)
    decoded = key.decode64(encoded)
